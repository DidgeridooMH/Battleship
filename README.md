A game of battleship written using Matlab. The player plays a game against a smart AI that can find ships after its hit a piece of one. The first player to sink all 5 of the opponent's ships wins! All images were made using Paint.net and/or Gimp 2. Audio implementation has been commented out due to licensing on audio files used.

## Usage
This program was written and tested in MATLAB R2017b. Older versions may lack required features to run. Point the working directory to the one containing scripts and run "Battleship.m". To use audio files simply placed the appropriately named files into a folder named "audio" at the root directory.
